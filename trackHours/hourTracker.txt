fix the following problems:
	Jim said last week: sometimes if i am putting my hours in at the same time as someone else, the program doesn't work
	Dave said last week: hey! did you know if I go to http://hourtracker/hours.db I can see everyone else's hours?! Jessica showed me last week!
	Ashley said yesterday: every time i log in, all my hours are gone
	Mary said today: Ralph fixed the program this morning but now it won't even load, it just says something about a problem
		
do the following:
	1.) re-write the code to conform to best practices as you understand them
	2.) implement two or more of the following enhancements:
		a.) convert the application to a single page application with clear division between client-side code and server-side code
		b.) migrate the application backend database to an appropriate database platform. Include instructions on how to create the DB schema (e.g. a .sql file)
		c.) enhance the application security to conform with what you believe to be minimal industry standards
		d.) migrate the application code to a popular PHP MVC framework such as CodeIgniter or Laravel
		e.) utilize an ORM to interact with the database
		f.) implement session handling. Assume this application will be running on multiple front-facing servers simultaneously
		g.) implement the following business rules:
			- a user cannot work more than 40 hours in a week
			- a user cannot work more than 10 hours in a single day
			- if a user works Saturday and Sunday, they must not work Monday
	3.) this program is ugly! show us your front-end styling and javascript skills!
